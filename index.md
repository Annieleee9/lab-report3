Part 1 - Bugs
1. A failure-inducing input for the buggy program,:![Image](lab3-1.png)
2. An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure:![Image](noerror.png)
3. The symptom, as the output of running the tests: ![Image](symptom.png)
4. The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it:
5. buggy code:![Image](buggycode.png)
6. fixed-code:![Image](fixedcode.png)
7. fixed-code-output:![Image](fixedoutput.png)
   The code is now fixed because originally the function would return a double without rounding it off, so we cannot input an expected value under such a situation. After the fix, the function now rounds to 2 decimal places so we can input an expected value.
   
Part 2 -Researching Commands
Find commands
1. Find everything: find  directory/ -ls 
This command finds files and directories within the given directory and its subdirectories then lists them with information such as permissions, owner, size, modification date, and the file or directory name.

-Example 1. Find command within the technical directory: it finds and lists all the file info within the given directory. In this case, it's all files within the technical directory. 
Command:![Image](lstechnical.png)
Output: ![Image](lstechout.png)
- -Example 2. find command within the technical/biomed directory: it finds and lists all the file info within the given directory. In this case, it's all files within the biomed directory that are inside the technical directory.
  Command:![Image](lsbiomed.png)
  Output:![Image](lsbiomedout.png)

 2. Find files by file name: find directory/ -type f -name "search keyword".
    This command finds only the files with the given keyword in the given directory. 
-Example 1.

4.  List just directories
5. Find a single file by approximate name
